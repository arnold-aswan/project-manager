## üß© Architecture & Logic Flow

- **Backend**: Handled via `/api-v1/auth` routes with JWT for session management.

### 2. Workspaces

- **Frontend**: Manage workspace lifecycle, members, and permissions.
- **Backend**: `/api-v1/workspaces` handles CRUD operations, invites, stats, and transfers.

### 3. Projects

- **Frontend**: Create/view/manage projects and their progress.
- **Backend**: `/api-v1/projects` manages creation, details, and archiving.

### 4. Tasks

- **Frontend**: Kanban boards, task assignment, comments, sub-tasks, priorities, etc.
- **Backend**: `/api-v1/tasks` for full task lifecycle and logs.

### 5. Members & Profile

- **Frontend**: View and manage workspace members, update user profile.
- **Backend**: `/api-v1/user` for profile and password management.

### 6. Data Flow

- REST API calls via **Axios** & **React Query**
- Routes protected by JWT
- Data validation enforced via **Zod** on both frontend and backend
